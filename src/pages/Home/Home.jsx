Simple is currently operational in multiple states of India as well as in Bangladesh, and is being used to manage more than 300,000 patients across more than 1000 clinics, with plans for deployment in additional program focus countries over the next year. Our goal is to save 100 million lives (\u003ca href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32443-1/fulltext\"\u003eThe Lancet\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn more about the Simple project at \u003ca href=\"http://simple.org\"\u003eSimple.org\u003c/a\u003e and in \u003ca href=\"https://www.simple.org/blog/what-we-are-learning/\"\u003ethis article on our blog\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eJob summary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimple is software that saves lives. Built using Ruby on Rails, Simple provides a web dashboard to healthcare workers and public health experts, enabling them to see where and how people are getting healthier. This dashboard is critical to helping improve blood pressure control rates across large populations, but also provides detailed information to help improve individual clinics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur Rails backend also provides a sync API to Simple’s Android app, allowing our offline-first design to work in clinics with limited network access. While this offers a unique set of challenges, it’s what makes our app fast and reliable for nurses every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re hiring a full-time Rails developer to help us add features to the Rails application and improve the APIs powering Simple. This includes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDelivering fast, simple software used by nurses in clinics every day\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorking on solutions for hundreds of millions of patients\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBuilding holistic products with empathy, not just writing code\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eContributing to an open source project used in multiple countries\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCollaborating closely with a talented, international team of Android and Rails developers as well as designers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSupporting an offline-first app, including the challenges of navigating a distributed system\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eManaging deployments in cloud and on-premise environments\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnsuring patient privacy and data security\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will help extend our API to allow for new features and apps, secure our application to meet security best practices, and ensure that our Rails app is reliable, scalable, and easy to modify. Our code has grown quickly, and you will help make sure that we keep complexity down, clean up technical debt as needed, and write code that doesn’t require extensive commenting and explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUser experience is critical to our success, so you will be working with our design team to make sure that we’re iterating quickly, as getting health data into official hands will help save lives. Our app needs to be easy to understand, for users and developers.

The ideal candidate embraces learning about our challenges, has solved Rails app-related challenges (especially at scale), and can work effectively with our entirely remote team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re keen to find someone for whom these problems look pretty familiar. We don’t want a specialist, but instead someone who is just as comfortable slinging ERB views as they are digging into writing query classes and debugging Rails routing errors. Critically, we also want someone who is curious, writes and communicates well, anticipates user needs from a human level, and always looks to keep things simple and iterate. We’re looking for someone who can self-manage, plans their time wisely, and delivers straightforward solutions to vague problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMindset\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe try hard to be a team full of empathy, inclusion, and respect. We trust each other, have hard conversations with open mindedness, and assume positive intent. We document as much as possible, work as asynchronously as possible, and meet via video conference when necessary. Proposing ideas and trying new things are paramount; always being right is not. We are frequently wrong and try to write code that we don’t mind deleting when we learn new things. We’re excited for you to participate and look forward to helping you grow your own skills as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDiversity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that we’re writing software for the globe, it’s critical that our team represent the diverse environments in which we operate.
